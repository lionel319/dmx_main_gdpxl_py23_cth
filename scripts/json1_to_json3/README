This script is to temporary address this ticket:-
   http://pg-rdconfluence:8090/display/NadderDMInfra/Database+Models+-+Rev+3

While waiting for the new json format to be provided, 
- reads in the json format from rev 1
- dumps out the json format for rev 3

... so that the progress/development on dmx codes to support this new format can move forward.
