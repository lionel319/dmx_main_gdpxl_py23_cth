The dm and abnrlib symlinks are temporarily in place as we migrate users 
from the old dm system to dmx.  Due to the PICE deadline, we don't have 
time to ensure all code has been migrated so to avoid broken imports,
we are maintaining the old python paths.

They should be removed once all code has been updated.
